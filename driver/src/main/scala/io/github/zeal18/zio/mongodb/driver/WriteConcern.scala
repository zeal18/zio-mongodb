/** Controls the acknowledgment of write operations with various options.
  *
  * ==`w`==
  * - 0: Don't wait for acknowledgement from the server
  * - 1: Wait for acknowledgement, but don't wait for secondaries to replicate
  * - >=2: Wait for one or more secondaries to also acknowledge
  * - "majority": Wait for a majority of secondaries to also acknowledge
  * - "<tag set name>": Wait for one or more secondaries to also acknowledge based on a tag set name
  *
  * ==`wTimeout` - how long to wait for slaves before failing ==
  * - 0: indefinite
  * - >0: time to wait in milliseconds
  *
  * ==Other options:==
  *
  * - `journal`: If true block until write operations have been committed to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with `fsync`.
  * Prior to MongoDB 2.6 this option was ignored if the server was running without journaling.  Starting with MongoDB 2.6
  * write operations will fail with an exception if this option is used when the server is running without journaling.
  *
  * == Implicit helper ==
  *
  * The [[ScalaWriteConcern]] implicit allows for chainable building of the WriteConcern eg:
  *
  * {{{
  *  val myWriteConcern = WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED.withJournal(true)).withWTimeout(Duration(10, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS))
  * }}}
