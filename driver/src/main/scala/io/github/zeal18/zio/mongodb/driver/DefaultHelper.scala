/** A helper containing the sealed `DefaultsTo` trait which is used to determine the default type for a given method.
  */
private[driver] object DefaultHelper {

  /** Neat helper to obtain a default type should one not be given eg:
    *
    * {{{
    *   def find[T]()(implicit e: T DefaultsTo Document) { ... }
    * }}}
    *
    * The signature of the `find` method ensures that it can only be called if the caller can supply an object of type
    * `DefaultsTo[T, Document]`. Of course, the [[DefaultsTo.default]] and `[[DefaultsTo.overrideDefault]] methods make it easy to create
    * such an object for any type `T`.  Since these methods are implicit, the compiler automatically handles the business of calling one of
    * them and passing the result into `find`.
    *
    * ''But how does the compiler know which method to call?'' It uses its type inference and implicit resolution rules to determine the
    * appropriate method. There are three cases to consider:
    *
    * 1. `find` is called with no type parameter. In this case, type T must be inferred. Searching for an implicit method that can provide
    * an object of type `DefaultsTo[T, Document]`, the compiler finds `default` and `overrideDefault`. `default` is chosen since it has
    * priority (because it's defined in a proper subclass of the trait that defines overrideDefault). As a result, T must be bound to
    * `Document.
    *
    * 2. `find`  is called with a non-Document type parameter (e.g., `find[BsonDocument]()`). In this case, an object of type
    * `DefaultsTo[BsonDocument, Document]` must be supplied. Only the `overrideDefault` method can supply it, so the compiler inserts the
    * appropriate call.
    *
    * 3. `find` is called with `Document` as the type parameter. Again, either method is applicable, but default wins due to its higher
    * priority.
